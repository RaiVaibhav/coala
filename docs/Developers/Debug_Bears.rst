Debug Bears
===========

This document provides a overview of coala's Debugging Interface.
The Debugging Interface will help users to debug Bear code and step through
it using the pdb interface.

After invoking coala's debugger it will step into the ``run()`` method of a
bear regardless of using ``yield`` or not and will step out as soon as a bear
finish analysis.

.. note::

    Pdb's quit-command (``q``) has been remapped so coala continues its
    normal execution without aborting. So, ``quit`` or ``q`` will first clear
    all breakpoints then continue execution.

Usage
-----

Command Line Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users can specify the bear they want to debug using ``--debug-bears``, i.e.

.. code:: shell

    $coala -b PEP8Bear,HelloWorldBear -f <filename> --debug-bears HelloWorldBear

Below is the code given for a simple ``HelloWorldBear`` that prints a debug
message for each file and display the passed information i.e.,
"A HelloworldBear." message.

.. code:: python

    import logging

    from coalib.bears.LocalBear import LocalBear


    class HelloWorldBear(LocalBear):
        def run(self, filename, file):
            logging.debug('Hello World! Checking file {}.'.
                          format(filename))

            yield self.new_result(message="A HelloworldBear.",
                                  file=filename)

After invoking debugger will step into ``run()`` method using
pdb ``runcall()`` i.e.,

    [    ]  1. (O)pen file
    [    ]  2. Add (I)gnore comment
    [    ] Enter number (Ctrl-D to exit):

If bear names are not specified for ``--debug-bears`` then it will by
default debug all the bears passed through ``--bears`` or ``-b`` argument.

.. code:: shell

    $ coala --bears HelloWorldBear -files <filename> --debug-bears

.. note::

    A bear may depend on results from different bears. The debugger will debug
    all bears on which a bear is dependent on as well.

coafile
^^^^^^^

Users can specify to debug bears using a ``.coafile``:

::

    [all]
    bears = PEP8Bear,MypyBear
    files = <filename>
    debug_bears = PEP8Bear

or

::

    [all]
    bears = PEP8Bear,MypyBear
    files = <filename>
    debug_bears = True
